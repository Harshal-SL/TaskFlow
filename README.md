# TaskFlow: Your Personal Task Manager üöÄ
TaskFlow is a simple, yet powerful, task management web application built with **React.js**. It helps users efficiently manage their to-do lists by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. With **local storage integration**, your tasks remain saved even after a page refresh.

## Features
### Task Management
- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify an existing task when needed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Keep track of completed tasks.

### Persistent Storage
- The app uses **local storage**, ensuring tasks are saved even after browser refreshes.

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile & Desktop Friendly**: Optimized for all screen sizes.
- **Adaptive Input Fields**: Prevents layout breakage when adding long tasks.

## How TaskFlow Works
